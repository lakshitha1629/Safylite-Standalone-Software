Project Description:-
In the modern-day society tuition classes have become one of the major way of giving education to the students in the current society. But building an interaction between children and parents is a difficult task. It tacks considerable time to do thinks manually so, to override this problem we are going to auto mate the manual system.
In the manual system following basic functions are provided,

1.Student, parent, teacher details registration.                                                                                           
2.Teacher’s Monthly class fees obtain from students.                                                                                       
3.Student’s attendance.                                                                                                                   
4.Student’s marks.                                                                                                                         
5.Information about students are passed to the parent every six month.                                                                     
But this manual process arises a number of problems.
